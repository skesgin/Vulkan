8. __The VKTS_Binaries folder has to be the working directory, otherwise shaders and assets are not found__.


---

Using Visual C++ 2015:
----------------------

   Add `-DVKTS_WSI=VKTS_NO_VISUAL` to create without windowing system.
3. Set the source code directory to VKTS.
4. Set the build directory to VKTS/MSVC (Note: This build directory is expected by the examples).
5. Open the Visual C++ solution file and __build VKTS first__.
6. Do step 3 to 5 with VKTS_Example*.
7. The executables are located in the [VKTS_Binaries](VKTS_Binaries/README.md) folder.
8. __The VKTS_Binaries folder has to be the working directory, otherwise shaders and assets are not found__.


---

Using make:
-----------

1. Install a GNU GCC toolchain.
2. Run CMake and configure "MSYS Makefiles" for Windows or "Unix Makefiles" for Linux.
   Add `-DVKTS_WSI=VKTS_NO_VISUAL` to create without windowing system.
3. Set the source code directory to VKTS.
4. Set the build directory to VKTS (Note: This build directory is expected by the examples). 
5. __Run make and build VKTS first__.
6. Do step 3 to 5 with VKTS_Example*.
7. The executables are located in the [VKTS_Binaries](VKTS_Binaries/README.md) folder.

Using LunarG SDK under Linux:
-----------------------------

Append the following lines to your `.profile` file in your home directory: 

`#`
`# Vulkan development setup.`
`#`

`export VULKAN_SDK=~/Development/VulkanSDK/1.0.26.0/x86_64`

`export PATH=$PATH:$VULKAN_SDK/bin`
`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/lib`
`export VK_LAYER_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/etc/explicit_layer.d`

`C_INCLUDE_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/include` 
`export C_INCLUDE_PATH`
`CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/include` 
`export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`
`LIBRARY_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/lib`
`export LIBRARY_PATH`

Finally, change the path of `VULKAN_SDK` depending on your installation directory and SDK version.


---

Installing Intel Linux Vulkan Driver:
-------------------------------------
  
Execute the following command to add the repository with the Intel Vulkan driver:  
  
`sudo apt-add-repository ppa:canonical-x/vulkan`  
`sudo apt update`  
  
Execute the following command to install the driver:  
  
`sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers`  
  
After this, create the following file if it does not exist:  
  
`/etc/X11/xorg.conf`  
  
Append/insert following lines to the above file to enable DRI3:  

`Section "Device"`
`    Identifier  "Intel Graphics"`
`    Driver      "intel"`
`    Option      "SwapBuffersWait" "0"`
`    Option      "DRI" "3"`
`EndSection`


---

Using Android NDK:
------------------

The needed shaders, textures and scene files are automatically copied into the assets folder by
executing `python build_project.py`. After the build, the assets are packed in the apk file. 

Note:
With the current beta NDK, copy the `include/vulkan` and `lib/libvulkan.so` from `android-24` to `android-23`,
as `android-23` is still used.

The following command builds the VKTS library:

1. Open console in `Android/jni` project folder and execute following command:  
    - `ndk-build`


The following command creates the Android project:

1. Open console in `Android` project folder and execute following command:  
    - `python create_project.py`

The following command copies the needed assets and builds the Android project:

2. Open console in `Android` project folder and execute following command:  
    - `python build_project.py`

The following command installs the Android project:

3. Open console in `Android` project folder and execute following command:  
    - `python install_project.py`

The following commands allows to display the log output:

4. Open another console execute following command in the `VKTS_Binaries` folder:  
    - `python android_log.py` 


Setting up the Android device:
------------------------------

The following has only be done once:

1. Enable developer mode on the Android device.
2. Enable USB debugging on the Android device.

The following has only be done once, if automatic TCPIP debugging is wanted:

1. Enable the wireless network on the Android device.  
2. Execute the following commands without the comments:  
    - `adb root`                         // Restart adb as root  
    - `adb remount`                      // Remount /system for read and write  
    - `adb pull /system/build.prop`      // Get the provided file  
3. Append 'service.adb.tcp.port=5555' in downloaded build.prop to autostart adbd in TCPIP mode  
4. Execute the following command without the comment:  
    - `adb push build.prop /system`      // Store the modified file  


Common adb commands:
--------------------

- List Android devices:  
    - `adb devices`  
- Restart adbd daemon with usb:  
    - `adb usb`  
- Restart adbd daemon with tcpip and given port:  
    - `adb tcpip 5555`  
- Connect to a TCPIP enabled device:  
    - `adb connect 192.168.0.12:5555`    // Change the IP address
